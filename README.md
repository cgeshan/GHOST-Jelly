# Ideaology
The goal of this project is to create a biomimetic jellyfish robot, which mimics the motion of a Medusozoa, and measure the water disturbance created. The hope is to reduce the amount of underwater disturbance which is deemed 'unnatural' by most aquatic life. In theory, mimicing the motion of the Medusozoa will reduce the amount of 'unnatural' disturbances and allow for closer observations to be conducted by underwater robots.
